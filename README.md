# Fhir.Patients

The project provides a foundational framework to work with the HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard, specifically focusing on the Patient resource. It includes functionality to perform basic CRUD operations over a FHIR-compliant API.

## Features

- HL7 FHIR CRUD Operations: Interact with the Patient resource using standard FHIR API operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Scalable Search Logic: Implemented dynamic search functionality that allows searching for resources using various input parameters.
- .NET 9: Developed using .NET 9, leveraging the latest features and improvements in the .NET ecosystem.
- .net [Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) support.
